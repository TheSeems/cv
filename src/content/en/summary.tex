    \par Software Engineer (Java/Python) focused on backend and data platforms. At Yandex, build internal services that deploy and operate Flink jobs at scale; shipped a JobGraph compilation flow that reduced average job startup time by 70\%. Comfortable owning production systems end-to-end: design, implementation, CI/CD, observability, and on-call improvements. Inclined towards distributed systems (Flink, ZooKeeper) and data stores (PostgreSQL); open-source contributor in my spare time.
